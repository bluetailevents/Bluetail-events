      <h1>About Bluetail</h1>
      <p>Bluetail is a UK-based mobile bar company that brings the party to you. As a sole trader company, we pride ourselves on offering personalized and professional services for all kinds of events.</p>
      <p>We offer two main services: an interactive service where guests can learn to make their own cocktails, and a made-to-order service where our skilled bartenders create cocktails for your guests.</p>
      <p>Payments can be made either through cash on the day of the event or bank transfer before the event. We prefer bank transfers for their convenience and security.</p>
      <p>Please note that our services are strictly for those over 21 years old. The person booking the event is solely responsible for policing the event. We hold public liability insurance and reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.</p>
      <p>For more information about our services or to book us for your next event, please contact us. We look forward to serving you!</p>
